## Overview

The Cresko Laboratory has been at the forefront of developing genomic tools and computational methods that have transformed evolutionary biology research. Our innovations have enabled cost-effective, high-resolution genomic studies in both model and non-model organisms, democratizing population genomics research worldwide.

## RAD-seq Technology Development

### Revolutionary Innovation

Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), developed through a collaboration between the Cresko and Johnson labs at the University of Oregon, has fundamentally changed how we study population genomics:

#### Core Advantages
- **Genome-wide coverage**: Thousands to millions of markers across the genome
- **De novo discovery**: No requirement for prior genomic resources
- **Cost effectiveness**: Orders of magnitude cheaper than whole-genome sequencing
- **Scalability**: From individuals to thousands of samples
- **Flexibility**: Adjustable marker density for different applications

### Methodological Refinements

Our continued development of RAD-seq methods includes:

#### Technical Improvements
- **2bRAD**: Simplified library preparation with uniform fragment sizes
- **ddRAD**: Double-digest RAD for improved repeatability
- **Paired-end RAD**: Enabling haplotype reconstruction and improved mapping
- **HDR-seq**: High-density RAD for fine-scale mapping
- **Rapture**: RAD-capture for targeted sequencing of specific loci

#### Protocol Optimization
- Enzyme selection strategies for different genome sizes
- Multiplexing approaches for cost reduction
- Size selection protocols for consistent coverage
- Quality control metrics and best practices
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
