Exciting new publication in G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics reveals rapid evolution of phenotypic plasticity in nematodes!

Dr. Kristin Sikkink, with co-authors Robert Reynolds, Kate Ituarte, Patrick Phillips, and Bill Cresko, demonstrates that apparent genetic assimilation can result from shifting thresholds of induction across environments. This groundbreaking work highlights the critical importance of environmental context for understanding evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

## Major Findings

The research reveals:
- Rapid evolution of plasticity thresholds
- Variable genetic assimilation patterns across environments
- Complex interactions between genes and environment

This study pioneered:
- Experimental evolution approaches in C. remanei
- Multi-environment selection experiments
- Analysis of shifting induction thresholds
- Integration of stress biology and evolution
- Novel frameworks for understanding plasticity

## Evolutionary Significance

The work demonstrates:
- Plasticity can evolve remarkably quickly
- Environmental context shapes evolutionary trajectories
- Genetic assimilation is more complex than previously thought
- Natural selection acts on reaction norms
- Stress responses are highly evolvable

## Experimental Design
