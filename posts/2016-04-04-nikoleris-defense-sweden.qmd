Dr. Bill Cresko recently served as the faculty opponent for Lina Nikoleris's doctoral thesis defense in the Department of Biology at Lund University, Sweden.

This prestigious invitation reflects Bill's international reputation in evolutionary biology and his expertise in population genomics. The Swedish doctoral defense system, with its formal opponent process, represents one of the most rigorous thesis examinations in academia.

## The Swedish Defense System

In Sweden, doctoral defenses feature:
- A distinguished external faculty opponent who leads the examination
- Public defense lasting 2-3 hours
- Detailed scientific discussion and critique
- Evaluation by an examining committee
- Celebration of the new doctor's achievement

## Lina Nikoleris's Research

Lina's thesis work focused on evolutionary biology topics that align with the Cresko Lab's research interests, including:
- Population genomics and adaptation
- Evolutionary responses to environmental change
- Genomic methods in evolutionary biology

## International Collaboration

Bill's role as opponent strengthens connections between:
- University of Oregon and Lund University
- US and European evolutionary biology communities
- International networks in genomics research

## Academic Exchange

These international engagements:
- Foster collaborative research opportunities
- Enable exchange of ideas and methods
- Strengthen global scientific networks
- Enhance the international profile of UO research

## Building Bridges

The Cresko Lab's international connections through events like this:
- Create opportunities for student exchanges
- Lead to collaborative grant proposals
- Advance the field through diverse perspectives
- Strengthen Oregon's reputation in evolutionary biology

Congratulations to Dr. Lina Nikoleris on her successful defense!
