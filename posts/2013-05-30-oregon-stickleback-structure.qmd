We're pleased to announce a major publication in Molecular Ecology revealing the population structure and colonization history of Oregon threespine stickleback!

This comprehensive study, led by Julian Catchen with team members Susan Bassham, Taylor Wilson, Mark Currey, Conor O'Brien, Quick Yeates, and Bill Cresko, uses RAD-sequencing to uncover patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and recent colonization events across Oregon's watersheds.

## Key Discoveries

Our genome-wide analysis revealed:

- Complex patterns of population structure across Oregon
- Evidence for introgressive hybridization in coastal populations  
- Recent expansion in central Oregon populations
- Human-mediated introductions in some watersheds
- Strong isolation by distance patterns

## Research Significance

This work demonstrates:

- Power of RAD-seq for phylogeographic studies
- Historical and recent colonization patterns
- Role of gene flow in population differentiation
- Impact of human activities on fish distributions
- Genomic signatures of adaptation

## Comprehensive Sampling

The study analyzed populations from:

- Coastal watersheds from Columbia River to Coos Bay
- Willamette Valley systems
- Central Oregon lakes
- Cascade Range habitats
- Over 20 distinct populations

## Technical Innovation

We employed cutting-edge approaches including:

- Genome-wide genetic diversity (π) calculations
- FIS analysis for population substructure
- Tests for introgressive hybridization
- Isolation by distance analyses
- Detection of recent colonization events

## Conservation Implications

Our findings inform:

- Management of native fish populations
- Understanding invasion dynamics
- Predicting responses to habitat change
- Conservation prioritization
- Restoration planning

## Evolutionary Insights

The research reveals:

- Rapid colonization of new habitats
- Complex patterns of gene flow
- Maintenance of genetic diversity
- Local adaptation signatures
- Metapopulation dynamics

## Research Team Excellence

This publication showcases:

- Collaborative field work across Oregon
- Integration of genomics and ecology
- Graduate and undergraduate training
- Team science approach
- Long-term research vision

## Data Availability

Supporting open science:

- Raw sequence data in public repositories
- Analysis pipelines available
- Detailed sampling information
- Reproducible research practices
