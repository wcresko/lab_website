Remarkable publication in PNAS demonstrates evolution occurring in just 50 years following the Great Alaska Earthquake!

Emily Lescak, Susan Bassham, Julian Catchen, Ofer Gelmond, Mary Sherbick, Frank von Hippel, and Bill Cresko show that stickleback populations in habitats created by the 1964 earthquake have evolved and differentiated to nearly the same extent as populations founded thousands of years ago. This groundbreaking work provides rare documentation of evolution on contemporary timescales.

## Extraordinary Discovery

The research reveals:
- Evolution in less than 50 years
- Differentiation matching ancient populations
- Repeated freshwater evolution from marine ancestors
- Contemporary evolution in action
- Metapopulation dynamics driving rapid change

## Natural Experiment

The 1964 earthquake provided:
- New freshwater habitats from uplift
- Known colonization timing
- Multiple replicate populations
- Natural evolutionary experiment
- Precise evolutionary timeline

## Genomic Evidence

Population structure analyses show:
- Rapid genomic differentiation
- Parallel evolution patterns
- Strong selection signatures
- Adaptive allele frequency changes
- Contemporary evolutionary rates

## Evolutionary Speed

This work demonstrates:
- Evolution visible in human lifetimes
- Rapid adaptation to new environments
- Standing variation enables quick evolution
- Parallel evolution occurs rapidly
- Natural selection's immediate power

## Conservation Implications

Findings inform:
