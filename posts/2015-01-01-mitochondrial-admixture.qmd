New publication in Journal of Biogeography reveals complex patterns of ancient mitochondrial lineage admixture in North Pacific stickleback populations!

Emily Lescak, Robert Marcotte, Leo Kenny, Frank von Hippel, Bill Cresko, Michelle Sherbick, Jessica Colgren, and J. Andrés López demonstrate high variance in mitochondrial clade composition at small geographical scales, with surprising patterns across the Aleutian and Kuril island chains.

## Key Findings

Our research reveals:

- Complex admixture of ancient mitochondrial lineages
- High clade composition variance at small scales
- Deep-water trenches don't partition genetic variation as expected
- Discordance between local and broad-scale patterns
- Complex colonization history of island populations

## Biogeographic Insights

The study demonstrates:

- Island chains show unexpected genetic patterns
- Ocean currents influence gene flow differently than predicted
- Historical sea level changes affected population structure
- Multiple colonization events shaped current diversity
- Geographic barriers have variable effects

## Sampling Excellence

Comprehensive coverage including:

- Aleutian Island chain populations
- Kuril Islands sampling
- North Pacific coastal sites
- Multiple individuals per population
- Comparison with historical samples

## Evolutionary History

The work reveals:

- Deep divergence between mitochondrial clades
- Secondary contact and admixture
- Complex demographic history
- Retention of ancestral polymorphism
- Variable rates of lineage sorting

## Conservation Relevance

Findings inform:

- Management unit delineation
- Understanding of genetic diversity patterns
- Climate change impact predictions
- Conservation prioritization
- Population connectivity assessment

## Methodological Approach

We employed:

- Mitochondrial DNA sequencing
- Phylogeographic analyses
- Admixture testing
- Geographic barrier analysis
- Comparative phylogenetics

## Collaborative Network

This international effort involved:

- Multiple institutions across the Pacific
- Field work in remote locations
- Museum specimen analysis
- Cross-cultural collaboration
- Student training opportunities
