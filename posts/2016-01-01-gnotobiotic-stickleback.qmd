Groundbreaking publication in Disease Models & Mechanisms establishes the gnotobiotic stickleback model system!

Kathryn Milligan-Myhre, Clay Small, Ellie Mittge, Meghna Agarwal, Mark Currey, Bill Cresko, and Karen Guillemin demonstrate that oceanic and freshwater stickleback populations differ in their innate immune responses to gut microbiota. This pioneering work establishes stickleback as a powerful gnotobiotic model for host-microbe interaction studies.
