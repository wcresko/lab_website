Exceptional news! Dr. Martin Stervander has been awarded a highly prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Individual Fellowship by the European Union!

Martin will spend two years at the Natural History Museum London studying the genomics of flight loss in birds, applying comparative genomics skills developed during his time in the Cresko Lab. His project, titled "The genomic underpinnings of convergent evolution: Repeated loss of flight in island rails, the greatest avian colonizers," scored in the top 70 of 9,700 evaluated proposals - an extraordinary achievement!

## About Marie Curie Fellowships

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowships are:

- Europe's most prestigious postdoctoral awards
- Highly competitive with <10% success rate
- Career-defining opportunities for researchers
