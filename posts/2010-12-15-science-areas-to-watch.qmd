We are thrilled to announce that genome scans and RAD sequencing have been named an "Area to Watch" in Science magazine's annual Breakthrough of the Year feature!

## Major Recognition

Science magazine, one of the world's most prestigious scientific publications, has recognized the transformative impact of RAD-seq and genome scan technologies on biological research. This recognition places our work among the most significant scientific developments of the year.

## What This Means

The "Areas to Watch" feature highlights technologies and research directions poised to transform their fields. For RAD-seq, this recognition validates:

- The revolutionary impact on population genomics
- Democratization of genomic analysis
- Enabling research in non-model organisms
- Cost-effective large-scale genetic studies

## RAD-seq Revolution

The RAD-seq technology developed at UO through collaboration between the Cresko and Johnson labs has:

- Enabled genome-wide studies in any organism
- Reduced costs by orders of magnitude
- Been adopted by thousands of laboratories worldwide
- Transformed evolutionary and conservation genetics

## Genome Scans

The ability to scan genomes for signatures of selection has opened new windows into:

- Adaptive evolution in natural populations
- Parallel evolution across independent lineages
- Genetic architecture of complex traits
- Conservation and management applications

## Oregon Innovation

This recognition highlights the innovative research environment at the University of Oregon, where collaboration between evolutionary biologists and molecular geneticists has produced tools now used globally.

## Looking Forward

This recognition comes as RAD-seq applications continue to expand. We anticipate the technology will continue to enable discoveries across:

- Evolutionary biology
- Conservation genetics
- Agricultural improvement
- Biomedical research

## Research Team

This recognition reflects the contributions of many researchers, including:

- Eric Johnson (Institute of Molecular Biology)
- Paul Hohenlohe (now at University of Idaho)
- Nathan Baird
- Angel Amores
- Susan Bassham
- Mark Currey
- William Cresko

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this achievement!
