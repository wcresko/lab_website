Important publication in Evolution & Development reveals how developmental timing differences underlie armor loss across stickleback populations!

Mark Currey, Susan Bassham, Shaun Perry, and Bill Cresko demonstrate that changes in ossified pelvic armor elements are linked to delayed and incomplete development of early-forming pelvic cartilage, providing mechanistic insights into this classic example of evolutionary change.

## Major Discovery

The research reveals:
- Developmental timing underlies armor loss
- Early cartilage formation is disrupted
- Incomplete development leads to vestigial structures
- Heterochrony drives morphological evolution
- Variable pelvic vestiges have developmental basis

## Evolutionary Development

Key findings include:
- Pelvic cartilage forms early in development
- Delayed development in derived populations
- Incomplete ossification patterns
- Developmental disruption cascades
- Predictable morphological outcomes

## Mechanistic Insights

The study shows:
- Cartilage template disruption
- Ossification timing changes
- Developmental trajectory alterations
- Cellular differentiation delays
- Morphogenetic process modifications

## Classic Evolution Example

This work illuminates:
- Textbook case of rapid evolution
- Repeated armor loss patterns
- Parallel evolution mechanisms
- Developmental basis of adaptation
- Predictability of evolutionary change

## Evo-Devo Integration

Findings bridge:
- Developmental biology and evolution
- Proximate and ultimate causes
- Genotype to phenotype mapping
- Micro and macroevolution
- Pattern and process

## Population Variation

The research documents:
- Variation across populations
- Spectrum of armor reduction
- Intermediate phenotypes
- Population-specific trajectories
- Environmental correlations

## Methodological Excellence

The study employed:
- Detailed developmental staging
- Cartilage and bone staining
- Comparative morphology
- Time-series analysis
- Multiple population sampling

## Broader Implications

This work informs:
- Understanding morphological evolution
- Developmental constraint theory
- Evolutionary predictability
- Adaptation mechanisms
- Phenotypic plasticity
