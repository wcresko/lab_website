Hope Healey and Susan Bassham have published an innovative method in *Genetics* that dramatically improves genome annotation for non-model organisms using single-cell sequencing technologies.

## The Challenge

Genome annotation - identifying genes and their functions - remains a major bottleneck for studying non-model organisms. Traditional methods often miss genes expressed only in specific cell types or developmental stages.

## Our Solution

The team developed a pipeline combining:
- Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for cell-type-specific expression
- Long-read Iso-Sequencing for full-length transcripts
- Custom computational tools for integration

This approach identified hundreds of previously unannotated genes in the threespine stickleback genome, improving our ability to study cell-type-specific gene expression.

## Applications

The method is particularly valuable for:
- Evolutionary developmental biology studies
- Understanding cell-type evolution
- Improving genome resources for ecological model systems
