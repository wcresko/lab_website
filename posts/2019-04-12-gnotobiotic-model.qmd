Our lab has successfully developed methods for generating and maintaining germ-free (gnotobiotic) threespine stickleback, opening new avenues for studying host-microbiome interactions under controlled conditions.

## Why Gnotobiotic Fish?

Gnotobiotic animals - those with no microbes or only known microbes - are essential for understanding:
- How specific microbes affect host biology
- The role of microbiomes in development and immunity
- Host genetic effects on microbiome assembly
- Causality in host-microbe associations

Until now, gnotobiotic techniques were limited to a few model organisms like mice and zebrafish. Extending these methods to stickleback leverages their natural genetic variation and ecological diversity.

## Technical Innovation

Developing gnotobiotic stickleback required overcoming several challenges:

1. **Sterile derivation**: Removing all microbes from eggs without damaging development
2. **Sterile maintenance**: Keeping fish microbe-free for months
3. **Validation**: Confirming absence of microbes using multiple methods
4. **Controlled colonization**: Adding specific microbes to study their effects

Our protocol, refined over two years, achieves >95% success rate in generating germ-free fish that develop normally.

## Research Applications

This system enables us to:
- Test how specific host genes affect microbiome assembly
- Measure microbe-specific effects on host gene expression
- Study immune system development in the absence of microbes
- Perform controlled evolution experiments with defined microbial communities

## First Results

Initial experiments reveal:
- Germ-free stickleback have altered intestinal development
- Immune gene expression differs dramatically without microbes
- Colonization with different bacteria produces distinct host responses
- Host genotype influences which microbes successfully colonize

## Open Science

We're preparing a detailed protocol paper and video tutorial to help other labs adopt this system. This tool will accelerate host-microbiome research across the stickleback community.
