Our collaborative team has published the first high-quality genomes of leafy and weedy seadragons in PNAS, revealing the genomic innovations underlying the spectacular biology of syngnathid fishes.

## Evolutionary Marvels

Syngnathid fishes (seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons) exhibit some of nature's most remarkable adaptations:

- Male pregnancy - unique among vertebrates
- Loss of pelvic fins and ribs
- Elaborate leaf-like appendages in seadragons
- Prehensile tails in seahorses
- Absence of stomach and teeth

## Key Genomic Discoveries

Our analysis revealed:

### Transposable Element Expansion
- Seadragon genomes contain 20-25% transposable elements
- Higher than other teleost fish (typically 5-10%)
- May drive rapid morphological evolution

### Gene Family Evolution
- Loss of genes for stomach development (consistent with anatomy)
- Expansion of immune gene families (possibly related to male pregnancy)
- Modified developmental gene regulation

### Comparative Insights
Comparing seadragons with seahorses and pipefish revealed:
- Convergent gene losses across lineages
- Lineage-specific innovations for unique traits
- Rapid evolution of reproductive genes

## Team Effort

This project represents six years of collaboration involving:

- **Lead authors**: Clayton Small, Hope Healey, Mark Currey
- **International partners**: Australia, Germany, Sweden
- **Sequencing**: PacBio long-reads plus Hi-C scaffolding
- **Computational**: Custom annotation pipeline for non-model organisms

## Conservation Implications

Both seadragon species are near-threatened. Our genomic resources will aid:

- Population genetics for conservation management
- Understanding adaptive potential
- Identifying populations at risk
- Informing protection strategies

## Open Data

All data are publicly available:

- Genome assemblies on NCBI
- Annotation files on FigShare
- Analysis code on GitHub
- Protocols on protocols.io
