We're excited to announce a new publication in Molecular Ecology describing major advances in the Stacks software package for population genomics!

Led by Dr. Julian Catchen with contributions from Paul Hohenlohe, Susan Bassham, and Bill Cresko, this paper presents powerful new extensions to the Stacks software that enable efficient analysis of genotype-by-sequencing data for population genomic studies. These tools are transforming how researchers worldwide study natural populations.

## About Stacks

Stacks is an open-source software pipeline for:

- Processing RAD-seq and related genotyping-by-sequencing data
- Identifying SNPs and genotypes in non-model organisms
- Calculating population genomic statistics
- Conducting phylogeographic analyses
- Managing large-scale genomic datasets

## New Capabilities

The publication describes major enhancements including:

- Population genomic summary statistics calculations
- SNP-by-SNP statistical tests
- Improved algorithms for genotype calling
- Scalability for large datasets
- Integration with downstream analysis tools

## Research Impact

Stacks has become essential infrastructure for:

- Conservation genomics projects
- Evolutionary biology studies
- Agricultural genomics
- Ecological genetics research
- Phylogeographic analyses

## Global Adoption

Since its release, Stacks has:

- Been downloaded thousands of times
- Enabled hundreds of published studies
