Important publication in General and Comparative Endocrinology reveals that exogenous iodide can protect against perchlorate-induced thyroid damage!

Adam Gardell, Frank von Hippel, Aubrey Adams, Danielle Dillon, Ann Petersen, John Postlethwait, Bill Cresko, and C. Loren Buck demonstrate that iodide supplementation significantly ameliorates most thyroid histomorphological phenotypes induced by perchlorate exposure, offering potential mitigation strategies for environmental contamination.
