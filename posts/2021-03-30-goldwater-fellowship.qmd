Clark Honors College undergraduate Emily Niebergall, who is working on her thesis in the laboratory with Emily Beck, has been awarded a prestigious Goldwater Fellowship for her outstanding undergraduate research.

## About the Award

The Barry Goldwater Scholarship is the most prestigious undergraduate award in mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering. Only 410 students nationwide receive this honor each year from a pool of over 5,000 nominees.

## Emily's Research

Emily's thesis project focuses on understanding neutrophil variation between oceanic and freshwater stickleback populations. Using advanced microscopy and genetic techniques, she's investigating how immune responses evolve as fish adapt to different environments.

Her work contributes to our broader understanding of:

- Immune system evolution
- Host-pathogen interactions
- Rapid adaptation to environmental change

## A Bright Future

Emily plans to pursue a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, with interests in combining genomics, immunology, and field ecology. The Goldwater Fellowship will provide support for her senior year and help launch her scientific career.

"Emily exemplifies the best of undergraduate research," says Dr. Cresko. "Her creativity, technical skills, and scientific thinking are already at a graduate level. We're thrilled to see her recognized with this honor."

Congratulations, Emily! We look forward to seeing your continued success in science.
