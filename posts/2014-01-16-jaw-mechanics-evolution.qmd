We're excited to announce a new publication in Biological Journal of the Linnean Society on the evolution of jaw mechanics in threespine stickleback!

This collaborative study with Heather Jamniczky, Emily Harper, Ryan Garner, Bill Cresko, Peter Wainwright, Benedikt Hallgrímsson, and Charles Kimmel reveals how modular organization of the opercular four-bar lever apparatus facilitates rapid evolutionary transitions. The work demonstrates a remarkable correspondence between functional modules and regions of morphological evolution.

## Key Discovery

Our research reveals:
- A modular boundary subdivides the jaw lever apparatus
- This boundary corresponds to regions of prominent morphological evolution
- Matched modular architecture facilitates rapid adaptation
- Integration patterns predict evolutionary changes
- Form and function co-evolve in predictable ways

## Evolutionary Innovation

The study demonstrates:
- Modular organization enables evolutionary flexibility
- Functional constraints shape morphological evolution
- Rapid transitions between habitats are facilitated by modularity
- Integration and modularity balance evolutionary potential
- Predictable patterns of phenotypic evolution

## The Four-Bar System

The opercular four-bar lever:
- Controls jaw protrusion and suction feeding
- Varies dramatically between populations
- Responds to ecological pressures
- Shows clear functional modules
- Evolves rapidly in new environments

## Methodological Approach

We employed:
- High-resolution morphometric analysis
- Functional biomechanical modeling
- Comparative phylogenetic methods
- Integration and modularity tests
- Evolutionary rate analyses

## Ecological Significance

This work explains:
- How fish adapt feeding mechanics to new prey
- Rapid evolution in colonized habitats
- Trade-offs between feeding modes
- Ecological opportunity and morphological innovation
- Predictability of adaptive evolution

## Evo-Devo Insights

The research bridges:
- Developmental biology and evolution
- Functional morphology and ecology
- Micro- and macroevolution
- Genotype-phenotype relationships
- Constraint and opportunity in evolution

## Collaborative Excellence

This publication showcases:
- International research collaboration
- Integration of multiple disciplines
- Advanced imaging and analysis techniques
- Theoretical and empirical synthesis
- Team science success

## Broader Applications

Findings apply to:
- Understanding vertebrate skull evolution
- Predicting evolutionary responses
- Biomimetic design principles
- Conservation of adaptive potential
- Evolutionary medicine applications
