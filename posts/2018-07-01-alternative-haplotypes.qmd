Major publication in Genetics reveals how repeated selection of alternatively adapted haplotypes creates sweeping genomic remodeling in stickleback!

Susan Bassham, Julian Catchen, Emily Lescak, Frank von Hippel, and Bill Cresko identify the distribution of adaptive haplotypes between freshwater and oceanic stickleback populations from recently uplifted volcanic islands in Alaska, demonstrating how standing variation enables rapid parallel evolution.

## Groundbreaking Discovery

The research reveals:

- Alternatively adapted haplotypes drive evolution
- Sweeping genomic remodeling occurs repeatedly
- Parallel evolution uses same genetic variants
- Rapid adaptation from standing variation
- Metapopulation dynamics maintain diversity

## Haplotype Architecture

Key findings include:

- Large haplotype blocks under selection
