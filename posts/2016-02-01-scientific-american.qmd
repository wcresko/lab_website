Susan Bassham was featured in Scientific American's Sustainability 60-Second Science video series discussing our lab's groundbreaking work on rapid evolution in stickleback populations.

## Fish on Evolution's Fast Track

The video, titled "Fish on Evolution's Fast Track," highlights our research showing that stickleback can evolve significant changes in less than 50 years - much faster than traditionally thought possible.

Susan explains how the 1964 Alaska earthquake created a natural experiment, isolating marine stickleback in newly formed freshwater ponds. These populations rapidly evolved traits typical of freshwater fish, demonstrating evolution in real-time.

## Research Impact

This work has important implications for:
- Understanding species responses to climate change
- Predicting adaptation to environmental disruption
- Conservation planning for rapidly changing habitats

The research was published in PNAS and has received widespread media attention for challenging traditional timescales of evolutionary change.
