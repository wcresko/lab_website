We are thrilled to announce a groundbreaking methodological publication in Genome Research that introduces Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) markers for rapid genetic analysis.

## The Innovation

Working with Eric Johnson's lab at the UO Institute of Molecular Biology, we developed a technique that enables rapid and cost-effective polymorphism identification and genotyping in any organism. This technology, called RAD (Restriction site Associated DNA) markers, represents a major advance in genetic analysis.

## How RAD Works

The method uses:

- Restriction enzyme digestion to sample consistent genomic locations
- Short DNA tags adjacent to restriction sites
- Microarray or sequencing-based genotyping
- Thousands of genetic markers from a single experiment

## Advantages

RAD markers offer several key advantages:

- Works in any organism without prior sequence knowledge
- Identifies thousands of polymorphisms simultaneously
- Cost-effective compared to traditional methods
- Enables population-scale studies
- Useful for genetic mapping and population genetics

## Applications

This technology opens new possibilities for:

- Genetic mapping in non-model organisms
- Population genomics and conservation genetics
- Association studies and QTL mapping
- Phylogeography and evolutionary studies
- Agricultural and aquaculture applications

## Research Team

- Michael R. Miller
- Joseph P. Dunham
- Angel Amores
- William A. Cresko
- Eric A. Johnson

## Impact

This publication launched a revolution in population genomics. The RAD technology and its derivatives (RAD-seq, ddRAD, 2bRAD, etc.) have been adopted by thousands of researchers worldwide, enabling genetic studies in virtually any organism.

## Technology Transfer

This innovation also led to the founding of Floragenex, a UO technology spinoff company that commercialized RAD genotyping services.
