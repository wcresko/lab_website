Our collaborative research published in PNAS explores the evolution and developmental genetics of facial bone morphology in threespine stickleback, revealing how changes in bone shape evolve in natural populations.

## Research Focus

Craniofacial bones in stickleback populations show striking variation, making them an excellent system for understanding the developmental genetic basis of morphological evolution. Our study focused on how these bones differ between populations and the genetic architecture underlying these differences.

## Key Findings

The research revealed:

- Significant variation in facial bone morphology between marine and freshwater populations
- Genetic mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting bone shape
- Developmental changes in bone formation contribute to adult morphological differences
- Both genetic and developmental mechanisms contribute to facial evolution

## Evo-Devo Integration

This work exemplifies the integration of evolutionary and developmental biology (evo-devo) to understand how phenotypic diversity arises. By combining genetic mapping with developmental analysis, we can trace how genetic variants affect developmental processes to produce evolved phenotypes.

## Broader Impact

This research demonstrates that stickleback provide a powerful model for understanding the developmental genetic basis of craniofacial variation, with implications for understanding both evolution and human craniofacial disorders.
