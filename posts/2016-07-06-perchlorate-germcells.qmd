Important publication in PLOS ONE reveals first evidence linking endocrine disruption to primordial germ cell reduction!

Ann Petersen, Nicole Earp, Shaun Redmond, John Postlethwait, Frank von Hippel, C. Loren Buck, and Bill Cresko demonstrate that perchlorate exposure reduces primordial germ cell (PGC) numbers in female threespine stickleback prior to the first meiosis during sex determination. This groundbreaking discovery connects environmental contamination to fundamental reproductive development.
