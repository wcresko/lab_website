Groundbreaking publication in Evolution reveals how environmental changes affect correlated responses to selection across complex genetic networks!

Kristin Sikkink, Robert Reynolds, Bill Cresko, and Patrick Phillips demonstrate that pleiotropy across stress response networks is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, highlighting the complex gene-environment interactions that influence organisms' ability to acclimate to novel environments.
