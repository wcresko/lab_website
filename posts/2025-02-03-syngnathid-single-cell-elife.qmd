Our team has published a groundbreaking study in eLife providing the first single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas for syngnathid fishes, revealing the developmental genetic basis of their extraordinary evolutionary adaptations.

## Extraordinary Traits

Seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons from the family Syngnathidae have evolved remarkable traits:

- Male pregnancy unique among vertebrates
- Elongated snouts
- Loss of teeth
- Dermal bony armor
- Extreme body elongation

## Creating the Atlas

We created a developmental scRNA-seq atlas from late embryogenesis Gulf pipefish (*Syngnathus scovelli*), describing:

- 38 distinct cell clusters
- 35,785 individual cells
- Comprehensive gene expression profiles
- Developmental trajectories

## Key Discoveries

### Elongated Face Development

We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express key regulatory genes:

- bmp4
- sfrp1a
- prdm16

These genes likely play important roles in the evolution of the characteristic syngnathid snout.

### Toothlessness

Our analysis found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, consistent with the complete loss of teeth in this lineage.

### Dermal Armor

We observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor, revealing how existing developmental programs were modified to create these protective structures.

### Brooding Pouch

Epidermal cells in our atlas expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the male brooding environment where embryos develop.

## Evolutionary Implications

Our results suggest that syngnathid evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, indicating that derived features originate from changes within existing gene regulatory networks rather than entirely novel cell types.
