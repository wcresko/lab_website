Our latest paper in *mBio* demonstrates that host genetic variation significantly influences gut microbiome composition, with implications for understanding host-microbe coevolution.

## Key Findings

Using two genetically divergent stickleback populations maintained in identical laboratory conditions, we found:

- **Host genotype effects**: Specific genetic variants associated with microbiome composition
- **High individual variation**: Even siblings showed substantial microbiome differences
- **Core microbiome**: Certain microbial taxa consistently associated with host genotype

## Technical Innovation

The study also established highly reproducible methods for 16S sequencing in fish, addressing a critical need for standardization in microbiome research. Our two-tiered approach achieves >95% reproducibility for abundant taxa.

## Broader Impacts

This work contributes to understanding:

- How host evolution shapes associated microbial communities
- The heritability of microbiome traits
- Potential for microbiome-based therapies
