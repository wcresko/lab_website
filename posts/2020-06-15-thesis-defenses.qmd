We're proud to announce that three lab members have successfully defended their Ph.D. dissertations this spring! Despite the challenges of remote defenses during COVID-19, they delivered outstanding presentations of their research.

## Dr. Emily Lescak
**Dissertation**: "Ancient Mitochondrial Lineages and Contemporary Adaptation in Threespine Stickleback"

Emily's work revealed cryptic mitochondrial diversity in stickleback populations and demonstrated that ancient mtDNA lineages don't constrain contemporary adaptive evolution. Her research combined phylogenetics, population genomics, and experimental approaches.

**Next position**: Research Scientist, Alaska Department of Fish and Game

## Dr. Kristin Alisha Sikkink  
**Dissertation**: "The Evolutionary Genetics of Stress Response Networks"

Kristin discovered that pleiotropy across stress response networks is highly sensitive to environmental conditions, with important implications for understanding evolutionary constraints and adaptation to multiple stressors.

**Next position**: Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Minnesota

## Dr. Allison Fuiten
**Dissertation**: "Genomic Architecture of Reproductive Isolation in Stickleback"

Allison's research identified genomic regions contributing to reproductive barriers between marine and freshwater stickleback, revealing how adaptation can lead to speciation.

**Next position**: Data Scientist, 23andMe

## Virtual Celebrations

While we couldn't gather in person, we celebrated with:

- Virtual defense parties with lab alumni joining from around the world
- Socially-distanced champagne toast outside the lab
- Commemorative lab t-shirts mailed to each graduate
- Video messages from former lab members

## Continuing the Legacy

These three join our growing community of Cresko Lab Ph.D. alumni who are making impacts in academia, government, and industry. Their success reflects not only their individual excellence but also the collaborative spirit of our lab.

"Emily, Kristin, and Allison exemplify the integration of rigorous science with creative thinking that we strive for in the lab," says Bill Cresko. "We're excited to watch their continued success in their new positions."

Congratulations doctors! The Cresko Lab family is proud of you!
