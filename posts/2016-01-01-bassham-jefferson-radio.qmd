Dr. Susan Bassham was recently interviewed by Jefferson Public Radio for a fascinating segment titled "When Evolution Speeds Up"!

Susan's engaging discussion brought cutting-edge evolutionary research to public radio audiences across Southern Oregon and Northern California. Her ability to explain complex scientific concepts in accessible ways makes her an outstanding science communicator and advocate for evolutionary biology.

## About the Interview

In this thought-provoking segment, Susan discussed:
- How evolution can occur on observable timescales
- The role of standing genetic variation in rapid adaptation
- Real-world examples of evolution in action
- Implications for conservation and climate change
- The power of genomic approaches to study evolution

## Key Topics Covered

Susan explained fascinating aspects of rapid evolution:
- Evolution happening in decades, not millennia
- How organisms adapt to human-induced changes
- The threespine stickleback as a model for rapid evolution
- Genomic mechanisms enabling quick adaptation
- Why understanding rapid evolution matters
