We're thrilled to welcome Dr. Martin Stervander to the Cresko Lab!

Martin joins us from Lund University in Sweden, bringing exceptional expertise in evolutionary genomics and a passion for understanding biodiversity. His arrival strengthens our lab's international connections and adds exciting new dimensions to our research program.

## About Martin

Dr. Stervander completed his Ph.D. in Evolutionary Biology at Lund University with a dissertation titled "On Speciation in Birds – Genomic Signatures Across Space and Time." His doctoral work combined:

- Traditional and next-generation DNA sequencing
- Studies of speciation processes in multiple bird groups
- Natural selection on bill morphology
- Phylogenomics and population genetics
- Field work across diverse ecosystems

## Research Background

Martin's doctoral research revealed:

- Genomic mechanisms of speciation
- Patterns of adaptive evolution in island birds
- Cryptic diversity in seabird populations
- Role of gene flow in speciation
- Genomic signatures of adaptation

## Postdoctoral Research Focus

In the Cresko Lab, Martin is investigating:

- Development and evolution of craniofacial morphology in pipefishes and seahorses
- Comparative genomics of syngnathid fishes
- Genomic basis of feeding apparatus evolution
- Convergent evolution in vertebrate morphology
- Integration of development and evolution

## Unique Perspective

Martin brings valuable expertise in:

- Comparative genomics across taxa
- Field biology and natural history
- Museum specimen genomics
- Phylogenetic comparative methods
- Science communication and outreach

## International Collaboration

Martin's presence enhances:

- US-European research connections
- Cross-taxonomic perspectives
- Methodological diversity
- Global scientific networks
- Cultural exchange in science

## Bridging Birds and Fish

Martin's transition from birds to fish genomics:

- Applies broad evolutionary principles
- Brings fresh perspectives to fish biology
- Enhances comparative approaches
- Strengthens evo-devo connections
- Advances vertebrate genomics

## Lab Contributions

We're excited about Martin's contributions to:

- Syngnathid genomics projects
- Mentoring graduate students
- Developing new analytical approaches
- Building international collaborations
- Advancing our research mission

Welcome to Oregon, Martin! We look forward to the discoveries ahead!
