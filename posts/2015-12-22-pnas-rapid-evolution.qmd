Our groundbreaking study documenting evolution of stickleback over just 50 years on earthquake-uplifted islands has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences!

This landmark paper provides some of the most compelling evidence to date of rapid evolution in nature, showing how threespine stickleback fish have adapted to new freshwater habitats created by the 1964 Alaska earthquake in just five decades.

## Major Findings

The study revealed:
- Evolution visible in 50 years
- Predictable phenotypic changes
- Parallel evolution patterns
- Genomic basis of rapid adaptation
- Natural selection in action

## The Natural Experiment

The 1964 earthquake created:
- Uplifted marine terraces
- New freshwater ponds
- Isolated stickleback populations
- Replicated evolution
- Real-time observation opportunity

## Evolutionary Changes Documented

In just five decades:
- Armor plate reduction
- Body shape changes
- Behavioral modifications
- Reproductive adaptations
- Ecological specializations

## Genomic Insights

We discovered:
- Standing genetic variation use
- Parallel genetic changes
- Selection signatures
- Adaptive alleles
- Evolutionary predictability

## Scientific Significance

This work demonstrates:
- Contemporary evolution
- Rapid adaptation potential
