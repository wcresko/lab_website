Congratulations to Dr. Emily Beck, assistant research professor in data science, who has received a 2021 Faculty Research Award from the University of Oregon!

## Award Recognition

Emily received the award for her project "Threespine Stickleback Fish: A New Model for Mitochondrial Diseases." This recognition highlights the innovative potential of using stickleback fish to study human disease mechanisms.

## Research Focus

The project aims to establish threespine stickleback as a model system for understanding mitochondrial diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide. Key aspects include:

- Leveraging natural genetic variation in stickleback populations
- Developing new assays for mitochondrial function
- Connecting genetic variants to disease-relevant phenotypes
- Building translational research approaches

## Why Stickleback?

Stickleback offer unique advantages for this research:

- Natural populations with diverse genetic backgrounds
- Well-characterized genomes and developmental biology
- Tractable laboratory system
- Established genomic resources from the Cresko Lab
- Ability to study population-level variation

## Mito-Nuclear Interactions

This work builds on Emily's research on mito-nuclear interactions, exploring how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes work together and how disruptions in this coordination can lead to disease.

## About the Award

The Faculty Research Awards are open to tenure track and full-time non-tenure-track faculty members engaged in substantial research. A committee of UO faculty members provides peer review of proposal merit.

## Emily's Background

Emily joined the Cresko Lab in 2015 and has contributed to research on:

- Host-microbiome interactions
- Population genomics
- Data science approaches to biology
- Mitochondrial biology

## Broader Impact

This award supports the development of stickleback as a biomedical model organism, extending the system's utility beyond evolutionary and ecological research into direct biomedical applications.

Congratulations Emily on this well-deserved recognition!
