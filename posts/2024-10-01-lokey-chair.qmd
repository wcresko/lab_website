Professor Bill Cresko has been awarded a Lorry Lokey Endowed Chair in recognition of the outstanding contributions that he and his laboratory have made to the University of Oregon's mission.

The Lorry Lokey Endowed Chairs represent one of the highest honors the University can bestow upon its faculty, reserved for scholars who have demonstrated exceptional achievement in their fields.

This recognition celebrates Bill's many contributions to science and the university:

- Development of RAD-seq technology and the Stacks software pipeline, now used by thousands of researchers worldwide
- Nearly 100 publications advancing our understanding of evolutionary genomics
- Service as Associate Vice President of Research and leader of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science
- Training dozens of students and postdocs who have gone on to successful careers
- Fostering collaborative research across campus and internationally

The endowed chair will provide additional resources to support the Cresko Lab's cutting-edge research in evolutionary genomics and the development of new computational tools for biology.

We thank the Lorry I. Lokey Foundation for their generous support of scientific research and education at the University of Oregon.
