Exciting news! RAD sequencing is being used to infer phylogenetic relationships in mosquito species, as featured in Science.

This publication demonstrates the expanding applications of RAD-seq technology beyond population genomics into phylogenetics. The study showcases how restriction-site associated DNA sequencing can resolve evolutionary relationships in disease vectors, providing crucial insights for understanding mosquito evolution and disease transmission.

## About the Research

The featured work demonstrates how RAD sequencing enables:
- Resolution of complex phylogenetic relationships in mosquitos
- Generation of thousands of phylogenetically informative markers
- Cost-effective genomic approaches for non-model organisms
- Better understanding of disease vector evolution

## Significance for Public Health

Understanding mosquito phylogenetics is crucial for:
- Tracking disease transmission patterns
- Developing targeted vector control strategies
- Understanding the evolution of insecticide resistance
- Predicting disease emergence patterns

## RAD-seq Innovation

This application shows the versatility of RAD-seq for:
- Systematic biology studies
- Species delimitation
- Phylogeographic analyses
- Conservation genetics

## Our Laboratory's Role

The Cresko Lab continues to pioneer RAD-seq applications, contributing to its adoption across diverse research areas from population genomics to phylogenetics.
