The National Institutes of Health has awarded our lab a five-year, $2.5 million R01 grant to investigate how host genetics shapes microbiome composition and function. This award will support multiple graduate students and a postdoc position.

## Project Overview

The grant, titled "Host Genetic Control of Microbiome Assembly and Function," will investigate:

- **Aim 1**: Identify host genetic variants affecting microbiome composition using GWAS
- **Aim 2**: Determine mechanisms through which host genes influence microbes
- **Aim 3**: Test evolutionary dynamics of host-microbiome interactions

## Novel Approaches

Our project combines several innovative approaches:
- Gnotobiotic stickleback system for controlled experiments
- Single-cell sequencing to measure cell-type-specific responses
- CRISPR validation of candidate genes
- Experimental evolution with defined microbial communities

## Collaborative Team

The project involves collaborations with:
- **Brendan Bohannan** (UO) - Microbial ecology expertise
- **Karen Guillemin** (UO) - Host-microbe interactions
- **Meta Center** - Systems biology of microbiomes

## Training Opportunities

This grant will provide:
- Support for 2-3 graduate students
- One postdoctoral position
- Summer undergraduate research positions
- Training in microbiome methods and bioinformatics

## Broader Impacts

Understanding how host genetics shapes microbiomes has implications for:
- Precision medicine approaches
- Agricultural applications
- Conservation biology
- Evolutionary theory

## Open Positions

We're recruiting for this project! We seek motivated individuals with interests in:
- Microbial ecology
- Population genetics
- Bioinformatics
- Experimental evolution

"This award recognizes our lab's unique position to address fundamental questions in host-microbiome biology," says Bill Cresko. "The natural variation in stickleback provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand these complex interactions."

We thank NIH/NIGMS for this support and look forward to advancing the field of host-microbiome interactions!
