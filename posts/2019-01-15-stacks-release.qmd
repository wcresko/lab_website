We're excited to announce the release of Stacks 2.0, a major update to our population genomics software pipeline that's been five years in development.

## What's New in Stacks 2.0

### Improved Core Algorithm
- New assembly algorithm with better handling of polymorphic sites
- Reduced false positive SNP calls by 40%
- Faster processing - up to 3x speed improvement
- Better memory management for large datasets

### New Features
- **Population module**: Integrated population genetics statistics
- **Genetic mapping**: Support for linkage map construction
- **Paired-end support**: Full integration of paired-end RAD data
- **Plotting tools**: Automated visualization of results

### User Experience
- Simplified parameter selection
- Improved documentation and tutorials
- Docker container for easy installation
- Cloud computing support

## By the Numbers

Since its initial release in 2013, Stacks has:

- Been cited in over 3,000 publications
- Processed data from 500+ species
- Been downloaded 50,000+ times
- Enabled population genomics in non-model organisms worldwide

## Community Contributions

Stacks 2.0 includes contributions from users worldwide:

- Bug reports and feature requests from hundreds of users
- Code contributions from 15 external developers
- Beta testing by 50+ research groups
- Translations into 5 languages

## Training Opportunities

We're offering workshops on Stacks 2.0:

- **PAG 2019** (San Diego, January)
- **Evolution 2019** (Providence, June)
- **Online workshop** (March, registration required)

## Looking Forward

Development continues with planned features:

- Machine learning for parameter optimization
- Integration with genome assembly tools
- Enhanced visualization capabilities
- Support for long-read sequencing data
