Major publication in General and Comparative Endocrinology reveals profound effects of perchlorate on reproductive and thyroid tissues!

Ann Petersen Furin, Frank von Hippel, John Postlethwait, C. Loren Buck, Bill Cresko, and Todd O'Hara demonstrate that developmental timing of perchlorate exposure critically affects angiogenesis, thyroid follicle proliferation, and sexual maturation, with significant implications for population dynamics.
