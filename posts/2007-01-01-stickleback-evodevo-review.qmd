Our comprehensive review published in Genetica establishes the threespine stickleback as a premier model system for integrating evolutionary and developmental biology.

## The Micro-Evo-Devo Synthesis

Studying the intersection of evolution and development (evo-devo) is a promising route for understanding the origin and diversification of organismal form. However, we identified a fundamental gap in the evo-devo synthesis: the integration of mathematical population and quantitative genetics with studies of how genetic variation in natural populations affects developmental processes.

## Why Stickleback?

The threespine stickleback offers unique advantages for this "micro-evo-devo synthesis":

- Countless replicate natural experiments in adaptation
- Phenotypic radiations within a single species
- Extremely rapid evolution on contemporary timescales
- Extant ancestral populations available for comparison
- Genetic and developmental tractability in the laboratory

## Research Progress

We review how stickleback research has begun to address:

- The genetic basis of morphological variation
- Developmental mechanisms underlying phenotypic change
- Sex determination evolution
- Speciation genetics
- Population genomics of adaptation

## Key Insights

The review highlights several important findings:

- Major loci control many evolved phenotypes
- The same genes are used repeatedly in parallel evolution
- Developmental changes can be traced to specific genetic variants
- Natural variation provides insights unavailable from lab studies

## Future Directions

We conclude that stickleback research is well-positioned to continue contributing to our understanding of how organismal diversity arises, bridging the gap between population genetics and developmental biology.
