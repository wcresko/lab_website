Important publication in General and Comparative Endocrinology reveals critical windows for perchlorate effects on stickleback skeletal development!

Ann Petersen Furin, Frank von Hippel, John Postlethwait, C. Loren Buck, Bill Cresko, and Todd O'Hara demonstrate that perchlorate exposure during the first 21 days post-fertilization causes lasting effects on dermal bone development, with implications for predator avoidance and survival.

## Critical Findings

The research reveals:
- Early developmental windows are most sensitive to perchlorate
- Concentration-dependent effects on bone growth
- Continuous exposure initiated early has greatest impact
- Small traits and abnormal morphology persist into adulthood
- Skeletal effects could impact survival in nature

## Developmental Sensitivity

Key discoveries about:
- Critical periods for thyroid hormone action
- Timing-dependent skeletal abnormalities
- Persistent organizational effects
- Developmental plasticity windows
- Endocrine disruption consequences

## Skeletal Impacts

The study documents:
- Dermal bone malformations
- Reduced skeletal trait sizes
- Abnormal morphological patterns
- Compromised defensive structures
- Long-term structural defects

## Ecological Consequences

Findings suggest impacts on:
- Predator avoidance ability
- Swimming performance
- Feeding efficiency
- Competitive abilities
- Population viability

## Thyroid Disruption

The work reveals:
- Hypothyroidism effects on development
- Thyroid hormone's role in skeletogenesis
- Compensatory mechanism limitations
- Tissue-specific hormone requirements
- Developmental timing importance

## Conservation Applications

This research informs:
- Critical exposure period identification
- Risk assessment refinement
- Water quality standard development
- Population impact predictions
- Management strategy optimization

## Methodological Innovation

The study employed:
- Stage-specific exposure protocols
- Detailed morphometric analyses
- Long-term developmental tracking
- Dose-response characterization
- Multiple developmental endpoints

## Environmental Relevance

Addressing concerns about:
- Widespread perchlorate contamination
- Developmental effects of pollutants
- Sublethal impacts on fish populations
- Long-term ecosystem consequences
- Regulatory threshold determination
