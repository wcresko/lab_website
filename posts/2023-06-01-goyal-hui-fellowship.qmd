Congratulations to undergraduate researcher Vithika Goyal for being awarded a Hui Fellowship!

This competitive fellowship will support Vithika's innovative research studying genetic diversity within and across populations of Bay pipefish in Oregon. Her work contributes to our understanding of population structure and adaptation in these fascinating syngnathid fishes.

## About the Hui Fellowship

The Hui Undergraduate Research Fellowship:
- Supports outstanding undergraduate research
- Provides funding for independent projects
- Recognizes research excellence

- Prepares students for graduate studies

## Vithika's Research Project

Vithika is investigating:
- Genetic diversity in Oregon Bay pipefish populations
- Population structure along the coast
- Gene flow between populations
- Local adaptation patterns
- Conservation genetics implications

## Bay Pipefish Biology

Bay pipefish (Syngnathus leptorhynchus) are:
- Common in Oregon's estuaries and bays
- Important members of seagrass communities
- Exhibiting male pregnancy like all syngnathids
- Sensitive to environmental changes
- Excellent models for population genetics

## Research Approach

Vithika's project employs:
- Population sampling across Oregon coast
- DNA extraction and sequencing
- RAD-seq genotyping methods
