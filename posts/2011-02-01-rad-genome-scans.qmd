The use of RAD sequencing for population genomic scans has been highlighted in Science!

This feature recognizes the transformative impact of RAD-seq technology on population genomics. The methodology, which our lab has helped pioneer, enables researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies and selection scans in organisms without reference genomes, democratizing genomics research across the tree of life.

## About the Highlight

Science magazine features how RAD-seq is revolutionizing:
- Population genomic studies in non-model organisms
- Detection of signatures of natural selection
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- Understanding of local adaptation

## Key Applications

The highlighted work demonstrates RAD-seq's power for:
- Identifying genomic regions under selection
- Mapping traits in natural populations
- Understanding population structure and gene flow
- Conservation genomics applications

## Methodological Innovation

RAD-seq enables researchers to:
- Generate thousands of genetic markers economically
- Study organisms without genomic resources
- Conduct population-level sampling at genomic scales
- Detect both neutral and adaptive genetic variation

## Our Laboratory's Contribution

The Cresko Lab has been at the forefront of developing RAD-seq applications for evolutionary genomics, contributing both methodological advances and empirical studies demonstrating its power.
