The National Science Foundation has awarded the Cresko Lab a major grant to study genomic evolution in unique 50-year-old threespine stickleback populations!

This exciting project will investigate stickleback populations that colonized newly-formed freshwater habitats created by the 1964 Alaska earthquake, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study evolution in real-time using cutting-edge genomic approaches.

## Project Significance

This grant enables study of:
- Real-time evolution
- Natural experiments
- Genomic changes over decades
- Rapid adaptation mechanisms
- Predictable evolution

## The 1964 Earthquake

The Good Friday earthquake:
- Magnitude 9.2
- Uplifted islands
- Created new ponds
- Isolated marine fish
- Started evolution clock

## Research Questions

The project addresses:
- How fast can evolution occur?
- What genes change first?
- Is evolution predictable?
- How does selection work?
- What constrains adaptation?

## Genomic Approaches

We will employ:
- RAD sequencing
- Whole genome sequencing
- Population genomics
- Comparative analyses
- Time series sampling

## Unique Opportunity

These populations offer:
- Known colonization date
- Replicated evolution
- Environmental gradients
- Ancestral comparisons
- Controlled timeline

## Field Work Component
