## Overview

Beneath the phenomena of evolutionary adaptation lies a complex lattice in which population-level processes intersect with developmental and genomic constraints. The Cresko Lab explores these multilevel interactions in the threespine stickleback fish, which offers unique advantages as a model system for understanding the genomic basis of adaptation.

## The Stickleback Model System

The threespine stickleback provides unparalleled opportunities for studying evolutionary genomics:

### Natural Experiments in Evolution
- **Replicate adaptation**: Countless independent colonizations of freshwater from marine ancestors
- **Phenotypic radiation**: Extensive morphological and physiological diversity within a single species
- **Contemporary evolution**: Examples of extremely rapid evolution on human timescales
- **Extant ancestors**: Marine populations representing the ancestral state still exist

### Experimental Advantages
- **Genetic tractability**: Ability to perform controlled crosses in the laboratory
- **Developmental accessibility**: External fertilization and transparent embryos
- **Genomic resources**: High-quality reference genome and extensive population data
- **CRISPR compatibility**: Efficient genome editing for functional validation

## Genomic Signatures of Natural Selection

By richly genotyping wild populations and generating controlled laboratory crosses, we investigate:

### Population Genomic Patterns
- **Selective sweeps**: Identifying regions under strong positive selection
- **Polygenic adaptation**: Understanding selection on standing genetic variation
- **Balancing selection**: Detecting maintenance of adaptive variation
- **Background selection**: Distinguishing selection from demographic processes

### Parallel Evolution at the Genomic Level
Our research reveals that a large proportion of the stickleback genome bears signatures of natural selection in replicate adaptations to freshwater:
- Identification of parallel genomic regions under selection
- Discovery of regulatory vs. coding sequence evolution
- Understanding the role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation
- Characterizing the genetic architecture of adaptive traits

## RAD-seq Innovation and Applications

RAD-seq (Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing), a method pioneered at UO through a Cresko and Johnson lab collaboration, revolutionized population genomics:

### Methodological Advances
- **De novo genotyping**: Genome-wide marker discovery without reference genomes
- **Cost-effective scaling**: Enabling population-level studies in non-model organisms
- **Flexible resolution**: Adjustable marker density for different applications
- **Paired-end improvements**: Building haplotype blocks for enhanced analyses

### Population Genetic Applications
The method enables continuous genomic scans using population genetic statistics:
- Detection of outlier loci under selection
- Demographic inference and population structure analysis
- Phylogeographic reconstruction
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

## Genomic Architecture of Adaptation

We investigate how genomic organization influences evolutionary processes:

### Structural Variation
- **Chromosomal inversions**: Their role in maintaining adaptive gene complexes
- **Copy number variation**: Gene duplications and deletions in adaptation
- **Transposable elements**: Mobile DNA as a source of adaptive variation
- **Recombination landscapes**: How recombination rate variation affects adaptation

### Gene Regulatory Evolution
- **Cis-regulatory changes**: Evolution of gene expression through regulatory mutations
- **Trans-acting factors**: Evolution of regulatory networks
- **Epigenetic variation**: Heritable changes beyond DNA sequence
- **Gene expression plasticity**: Environmental effects on gene regulation

## Phylogeography and Population History

Using paired-end RAD-seq data to build haplotype blocks, we employ coalescent approaches to investigate:

### Historical Demography
- **Colonization history**: Timing and routes of freshwater invasions
- **Population expansions**: Demographic changes following colonization
- **Gene flow patterns**: Ongoing migration between populations
- **Hybridization zones**: Introgression between divergent populations

### Molecular Dating
- **Age of adaptive alleles**: When beneficial mutations arose or were selected
- **Divergence times**: Dating population splits and colonization events
- **Mutation rate calibration**: Using known geological events to calibrate molecular clocks
- **Ancestral state reconstruction**: Inferring historical character states

## Gene-by-Environment Interactions

Understanding how genetic variation interacts with environmental factors:

### Environmental Variables
- **Temperature adaptation**: Thermal tolerance and performance curves
- **Salinity tolerance**: Osmoregulatory adaptations
- **Dietary adaptations**: Genetic basis of trophic specialization
- **Parasite resistance**: Host-pathogen coevolution

### Experimental Approaches
- **Common garden experiments**: Separating genetic from environmental effects
- **Reciprocal transplants**: Testing local adaptation
- **Selection experiments**: Real-time evolution under controlled conditions
- **Plasticity studies**: Reaction norm evolution
