## Our Mission

The Cresko Laboratory advances our understanding of evolutionary processes through integrative genomic research. We seek to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation, the dynamics of host-microbiome interactions, and the genomic basis of evolutionary change.

Read about our [laboratory expectations](expectations.qmd).

## Our Approach

We believe that understanding evolution requires a multi-faceted approach:

-   **Field Studies**: We conduct long-term monitoring of natural populations across the Pacific Northwest
-   **Laboratory Experiments**: We use controlled experiments to test evolutionary hypotheses
-   **Computational Biology**: We develop and apply cutting-edge bioinformatic tools
-   **Open Science**: We share our data, code, and methods openly with the scientific community

## Our History

The Cresko Laboratory was established in 2005 when Bill Cresko joined the University of Oregon faculty. Since then, we have:

-   Published nearly 150 peer-reviewed papers
-   Developed RAD-seq technology, revolutionizing population genomics
-   Created Stacks, now used by over 5,000 researchers worldwide
-   Trained dozens of graduate students and postdocs
-   Secured continuous funding from NSF, NIH, and private foundations such as Keck and Moore

## Our Values

### Excellence in Science

We strive for rigorous, reproducible research that advances fundamental knowledge while addressing real-world challenges.

### Inclusive Community

We foster a diverse, supportive environment where all members can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives.

### Collaborative Spirit

We actively collaborate with researchers worldwide, believing that the best science emerges from diverse partnerships.

### Mentorship & Training

We are committed to training the next generation of scientists through hands-on research experience and professional development.

## Our Impact

### Scientific Contributions

-   **RAD-seq Technology**: Enabled genome-wide studies in thousands of non-model organisms
-   **Stacks Software**: Democratized population genomics analyses for the global research community
-   **Evolutionary Insights**: Advanced understanding of parallel evolution and adaptation

### Education & Outreach

-   Trained over 50 undergraduate researchers
-   Mentored 25+ graduate students and 15+ postdocs
-   Engaged with K-12 students through outreach programs
-   Contributed to science communication and public understanding

## Our Location

We are located in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. Our facilities include:

-   State-of-the-art molecular biology laboratories
-   High-performance computing resources
-   Aquatic animal care facilities
-   Access to diverse field sites throughout Oregon

The University of Oregon provides an exceptional environment for evolutionary research, with strengths in: - Genomics and bioinformatics - Ecology and evolution - Data science - Environmental sciences

## Funding & Support

Our research is generously supported by:

-   National Science Foundation (NSF)
-   National Institutes of Health (NIH)
-   Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
-   M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust
