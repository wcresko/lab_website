## Overview

The Cresko Laboratory studies the genomic basis of evolutionary change using comparative studies of natural populations in the wild and experimental approaches in the laboratory. Our research combines field work, laboratory experiments, and computational approaches to understand how organisms adapt to changing environments.

## Major Research Areas

### Evolutionary Genomics of Adaptation

We investigate how organisms adapt to new environments at the genomic level. Using the threespine stickleback fish as our primary model system, we study:

-   **Parallel evolution**: How do independent populations evolve similar solutions to environmental challenges?
-   **Genomic architecture**: What is the genetic basis of complex adaptive traits?
-   **Evolutionary constraints**: What factors limit or facilitate evolutionary change?

Our work has revealed fundamental principles about how natural selection shapes genomic variation and produces evolutionary change.

### Host-Microbiome Coevolution

Recently, our lab has developed stickleback as a model for studies of how host genetic variation influences associated microbial communities. This research addresses:

-   How host genetics shapes microbiome composition
-   The role of the microbiome in host adaptation
-   Coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their microbiota
-   Environmental influences on host-microbiome interactions

### Population Genomics Methods Development

Our laboratory has been at the forefront of developing genomic tools and computational methods for evolutionary biology:

#### RAD-seq Technology

We developed Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), a method that has revolutionized population genomics by enabling cost-effective genome-wide SNP discovery and genotyping in non-model organisms.

#### Stacks Software Pipeline

We created Stacks, a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences. Stacks is now used by thousands of researchers worldwide for:

- De novo and reference-based assembly of RAD-seq data
- SNP discovery and genotyping
- Population genomics analyses
- Phylogenomics applications

### Syngnathid Fish Evolution

In collaboration with international partners, we study the unique evolutionary innovations of syngnathid fishes (seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons):

-   Male pregnancy and its genomic basis
-   Evolution of morphological novelties
-   Comparative genomics across the syngnathid phylogeny
-   Conservation genomics of threatened species

### Evolution of Development

We investigate how developmental processes evolve to produce morphological diversity:

-   Genetic basis of phenotypic evolution across time scales
-   Rapid morphological evolution in stickleback populations
-   Deep evolutionary innovations in syngnathid fishes
-   CRISPR-based functional validation of developmental evolution
