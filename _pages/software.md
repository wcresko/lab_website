[![Stacks](stacks/images/stacks_logo_small.png)](http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/ "Stacks")

Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci out of a set of
short-read sequenced samples. Stacks was developed for the purpose of
building genetic maps from RAD-Tag Illumina sequence data, but can also
be readily applied to population studies, and phylogeography.

[The Synteny
Database](http://syntenydb.uoregon.edu/ "The Synteny Database")

The Synteny Database is a system built to detect conserved synteny \--
the tendency of neighboring genes to retain their relative positions and
orders on chromosomes over evolutionary time (synteny: syn, same; tene,
thread). Given a source genome and an outgroup genome the Synteny
Database can detect regions of conserved synteny within the source
genome (paralogons), or between the source and outgroup genomes. The
system was built with special care to detect paralogons originating from
whole-genome duplication. The Synteny Database is meant to aid the study
of the evolutionary history of gene families across multiple lineages.
