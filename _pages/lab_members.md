## Present Members

**Susie Bassham, Senior Research Associate**
> What are the developmental and genetic bases of evolution in natural populations?
Using a variety of molecular genetic tools, I try to uncover genome-scale patterns
that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and to direct this
knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified
morphologies.

**Mark Currey, Senior Research Assistant**
> Mark needs to say something about himself

____________

**Clay Small, Research Associate**
> The characterization of transcriptomic phenotypes using RNA-seq is a promising approach for understanding
how genomes serve as conduits for the origin, maintenance and modification of ecologically relevant traits.
To this end, I study the male pregnancy transcriptome in syngnathid fishes, and how genotype-by-environment
interactions affect the microbe-associated gastrointestinal transcriptome of threespine stickleback.

____________

**Martin Stervander, Postdoctoral Scholar**
> I am broadly interested in evolutionary biology and ecology, with a passion
for birds. In my PhD project, I used traditional and “next generation” DNA
sequencing to study speciation processes in several groups of birds, and
focused on natural selection on bill morphology. In my postdoc project I keep
my eye on the feeding apparatus, but go below the surface to study the
development and evolution of the highly derived craniofacial morphology of
pipefishes and seahorses.
