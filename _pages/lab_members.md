## Bill Cresko, Principal Investigator

>I am a geneticist who specializes in quantitative evolutionary genomics. Our laboratory studies the developmental genetic and genomic basis of evolution in natural populations using a variety of laboratory and field approaches tightly connected to innovation in genomics and quantitative biology.

> What are the developmental and genetic bases of evolution in natural populations?
Using a variety of molecular genetic tools, I try to uncover genome-scale patterns
that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and to direct this
knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.

> I’m interested in understanding the vast variety of life. How is morphological
variation, seen in populations of the same species, partitioned among different
environments and what are the genetic and genomic factors associated with this
partitioning? To get at this I’m investigating the distribution of populations of
threespine stickleback in Oregon, looking for patterns of association between
phenotype and environment, and ultimately querying the genomes of these populations
to associate patterns we see at the phenotypic level with patterns at the genetic
and genomic level.

>  I am a geneticist with a long-standing interest in how genetic interactions 
influence evolutionary dynamics and how those dynamics impact disease states. My 
doctoral thesis work primarily focused on mitochondrial and nuclear genome interactions 
as they relate to speciation in Drosophila. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I significantly 
extended my experiences to focus on host-microbe interactions and their broader influences on 
progression of disease states in outbred threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

**Clay Small, Research Associate**

> The characterization of transcriptomic phenotypes using RNA-seq is a promising approach for understanding
how genomes serve as conduits for the origin, maintenance and modification of ecologically relevant traits.
To this end, I study the male pregnancy transcriptome in syngnathid fishes, and how genotype-by-environment
interactions affect the microbe-associated gastrointestinal transcriptome of threespine stickleback.

**Hope Healey, Ph.D. Student**

> I am interested in the developmental genetic basis of novel teleost morphologies. In particular, 
I am fascinated by syngnathids due to their highly modified traits and alterations in key developmental 
gene families. I hope to understand how gene regulatory networks have been modified in syngnathids to 
create unique morphologies such as their derived craniofacial features.

**Shannon Snyder, Ph.D. Student**

> My dissertation work is focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms governing within and between generational phenotypic plasticity. By capitalizing on the invasive water flea, Daphnia lumholtzi’s, dramatic morphological response to predation, I am working to disentangle the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this plastic response and its persistence over generational time.
