**History**: Ph.D. Biology, University of Oregon

**Thesis Title**: “Molecular embryology of a larvacean urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, and the origin of chordate innovations”

**Research Interests**: Research Interest: What are the developmental and genetic bases of evolution in natural populations? Using a variety of molecular genetic tools, I try to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and to direct this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.
