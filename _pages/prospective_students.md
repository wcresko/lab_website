I am pleased that you are interested in graduate study at the University of Oregon. 
You will find that UO offers outstanding opportunities in graduate studies in all manner of quantitative ecology and evolution. 
There are many aspects of our graduate program that receive international recognition for excellence. 
I encourage you to visit the departmentâ€™s and institute's web pages to learn more about the faculty, post-docs, students, and their current projects.

The work in my lab is conceptually-driven research at the interface of evolution, ecology, and development with specific focus on quantitative genomics. 
Much of the work in our laboratory utilizes cutting edge genomic tools in the laboratory (some of which we developed), as well as advanced quantitative approaches
To learn more about the latest research projects in the lab visit the 'research' page, and also see the recent papers from the laboratory under 'publications'. 

__What are my expectations of a graduate student?__  
I seek students who are highly motivated and serious about science, who enjoy being productive and creative, 
and who view their work as a continuing progress driven by the constant expansion of their knowledge and ability.
I strongly encourage students to develop the ability to present their work and ideas in the most clear and succinct manner, 
and to design interesting and non-trivial research program. 
While you can expect me to be very helpful in these areas, I am not particularly interested in intervening into minute details of your daily graduate work or progress. 
I am however, very interested in providing you with time and resources to develop and conduct your own study.
Generally, I encourage my students to have a significant empirical component in their projects, 
but also value and support the development and use of theory and simulations. 

__What are my expectations of a graduate student?__  
What are my commitments to you?
I invest a great deal of time in helping such students to succeed. 
I will ensure that you have the critical resources necessary to succeed, including space and money for research, 
but perhaps the most important is my time and guidance.
I commit to all of my students that they will be able to complete their degrees in a timely fashion,
and I will make sure that they acquire the necessary professional skills and build a network that allows them to succeed.
I ensure that our laboratory environment is a respectful environment that values a diversity of life experiences and thought.


__If you are interested in becoming a member of my lab, you should:__

1). Read the statement of research interests and the research statements of all people currently working in the lab.

2). Read some of the papers that my students, collaborators and I have published in recent years. 
The more papers you read the better understanding you will have of research and approaches that we are using in our work.

3). If, afer (1) and (2), you still think that our research interests are similar, please send me a detailed letter in which you should include the following:

- The reasons for your interest in graduate research in general and in my lab in particular. 
- Why do you want to be a scientist? What excites you about science?
- Include your resume, any publications (or references to published work), relevant qualifications, 
classes, and any additional material (e.g., proposals) that you think may be useful for your application
- The names and institutions of the people you will ask for letters of recommendation (letters are not necessary at this time)
- Include your GPA and a list of the math or statistics classes you have taken, and any experience with molecular/physiological and other laboratory techniques and methods

4). About a week after you send the materials above, please e-mail me to inquire about your suitability and likehood of acceptance to the lab. (Please note however that the ranking and acceptance decisions are made by the entire faculty).

5). Go ahead and apply! To apply and for general information on the graduate school, application forms, required exams, and related materials please consult the UA and EEB graduate school web pages.


__Please do not hesitate to contact me or any of the lab members if you have any questions.__
