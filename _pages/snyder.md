excerpt: "Evolution of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity"

**Research Interests**: My dissertation work is focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms governing within and between generational phenotypic plasticity. By capitalizing on the invasive water flea, Daphnia lumholtziâ€™s, dramatic morphological response to predation, I am working to disentangle the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this plastic response and its persistence over generational time.
