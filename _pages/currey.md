**Thesis Title**: “The Phenotypic and Genetic Distribution of Threespine Stickleback that Inhabit the Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA”

**Research Interests**: I'm interested in understanding the vast variety of life. How is morphological variation, seen in populations of the same species, partitioned among different environments and what are the genetic and genomic factors associated with this partitioning? To get at this I'm investigating the distribution of populations of threespine stickleback in Oregon, looking for patterns of association between phenotype and environment, and ultimately querying the genomes of these populations to associate patterns we see at the phenotypic level with patterns at the genetic and genomic level.
