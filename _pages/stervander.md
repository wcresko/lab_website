**Biography**: Martin Stervander is a postdoctoral research fellow on a three-year grant from the Swedish Research Council. In the Cresko Lab at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (IE2), University of Oregon, he does research in comparative genomics of syngnathid fishes. With a background in phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of birds, his overall research interests span microevolutionary dynamics to large-scale macroevolution. Stervander received his PhD at Lund University, Sweden, in 2015 with a thesis on speciation in birds. His PhD advisors were Drs. Bengt Hansson and Staffan Bensch. Stervander has published some 20 papers that have been cited over a thousand times.
