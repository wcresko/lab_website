### William A. Cresko, Ph.D.
**Professor of Biology | Associate Vice President of Research | Lorry Lokey Endowed Chair**

Bill is fascinated by the diversity of life. The goal of our lab is to understand how it arises - what genes and developmental processes are involved, how changes in these systems are integrated into genomes, and how these proximate mechanisms affect ultimate evolutionary processes. Our lab uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to address these and other evolutionary genetic questions.

Bill is a Professor of Biology and member of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon, with leadership roles as associate vice president of research and leader of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science. He is also a member of the Internal Advisory Board for the Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact.

## Research Scientists

### Susan Bassham, Ph.D.
**Senior Research Associate**

Susan uses a variety of molecular genetic tools to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and to direct this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies. Her work on RAD-seq development and stickleback evolution has been foundational to the lab's research program.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

### Martin Stervander, Ph.D.
**Swedish Research Council Fellow**

Martin is broadly interested in evolutionary biology and ecology. In his postdoc project he studies the development and evolution of the highly derived craniofacial morphology of pipefishes and seahorses. With a background in phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of birds, his overall research interests span microevolutionary dynamics to large-scale macroevolution.

## Graduate Students

### Clayton M. Small
**Ph.D. Candidate**

Clayton studies genotype-by-environment interactions affecting the microbe-associated gastrointestinal transcriptome of threespine stickleback. His work has revealed important insights into host-microbiome interactions and the role of host genetics in shaping microbial communities.

### Emily A. Beck
**Ph.D. Candidate** 

Emily is interested in the genetics of adaptation and how complex traits evolve quickly in response to new or changing environments. Her work focuses on mitochondrial-nuclear interactions and their role in evolutionary adaptation.

### Mark C. Currey
**Ph.D. Candidate**

Mark characterizes transcriptomic phenotypes using RNA-seq to understand how genomes serve as conduits for the origin, maintenance and modification of ecological variation. His work on Oregon stickleback populations has revealed patterns of genetic divergence across different timescales.

### Hannah M. Healey
**Ph.D. Student**

Hannah applies single-cell sequencing technologies to understand developmental processes and gene expression variation in stickleback. Her innovative approaches have improved genome annotation methods for non-model organisms.
