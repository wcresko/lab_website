University of Oregon

Bill Cresko is a Professor of Biology and a member of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (IE2) at the University of Oregon. He has leadership roles on campus as associate vice president of research and leader of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science. Cresko studies the genomic basis of evolutionary change using comparative studies of natural populations in the wild and experimental approaches in the laboratory. He uses the threespine stickleback fish as his primary model to understand how molecular genetic variation can modify networks of genes and proteins to produce variation in evolutionarily important traits.

**Senior Research Associate**\
Institute of Ecology and Evolution\
University of Oregon

Susan is interested in understanding the vast variety of life. How is morphological variation, seen in populations of the same species, partitioned among different environments and what are the genetic and genomic factors associated with this partitioning? She uses a variety of molecular genetic tools to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and directs this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.

**Swedish Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow**\
Institute of Ecology and Evolution\
University of Oregon

Martin is a postdoctoral research fellow on a three-year grant from the Swedish Research Council. In the Cresko Lab, he does research in comparative genomics of syngnathid fishes. With a background in phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of birds, his overall research interests span microevolutionary dynamics to large-scale macroevolution. He received his PhD at Lund University, Sweden, in 2015 with a thesis on speciation in birds.
