**Lorry Lokey Chair and Professor of Bioengineering, Director Center for Biomedical Data Science**\
Institute of Ecology and Evolution\
University of Oregon

Bill Cresko is Lorry Lokey Chair and Professor of Bioengineering, and a member of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (IE2) at the University of Oregon. He has had leadership roles on campus as the director of IE2, associate vice president of research (2014-2018), and the executive director of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science (2018-2023). He is currently the UO Director of the Center for Biomedical Data Science. Cresko studies the genomic basis of evolutionary change using comparative studies of natural populations in the wild and experimental approaches in the laboratory. He uses the threespine stickleback fish as his primary model to understand how molecular genetic variation can modify networks of genes and proteins to produce variation in evolutionarily important traits.

**Senior Research Associate**\
Institute of Ecology and Evolution\
University of Oregon

Susan is interested in understanding the vast variety of life. How is morphological variation, seen in populations of the same species, partitioned among different environments and what are the genetic and genomic factors associated with this partitioning? She uses a variety of molecular genetic tools to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and directs this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.

## Lab Alumni

### Postdoctoral Scholars

- **Clayton (Clay) Small, Ph.D.** - Now Assistant Professor at \[Institution\] **Contact:** csmall\@uoregon.edu\ [Research](research.html#small)

-  **Martin Stervander, Ph.D.** - Postdoctoral Fellow Martin was a postdoctoral research fellow on a three-year grant from the Swedish Research Council. In the Cresko Lab, he does research in comparative genomics of syngnathid fishes. With a background in phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of birds, his overall research interests span microevolutionary dynamics to large-scale macroevolution. He received his PhD at Lund University, Sweden, in 2015 with a thesis on speciation in birds.

- **Emily Beck, Ph.D.** - Postdoctoral Fellow - Emily's research focuses on the evolutionary genomics of adaptation in natural populations. She is particularly interested in understanding how genetic variation influences phenotypic diversity and adaptation to different environments. Her work combines population genomics, quantitative genetics, and experimental approaches to understand evolutionary processes.

- **Hannah Tavalire, Ph.D.** - Postdoctoral Scholar and Research Associate - Hannah's research focuses on the genomics of host-microbiome interactions and how genetic variation influences microbial community composition. She uses computational and experimental approaches to understand these complex biological systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
