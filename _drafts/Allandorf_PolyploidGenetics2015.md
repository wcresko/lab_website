Polyploid genomes, such as in salmonid fishes, present special challenges for understanding understanding of population and evolutionary genetics, and many genetic studies intentionally exclude parts of the genome that show residual tetrasomic inheritance. This work explores how incorporating these loci will benefit our understanding of population and evolutionary genetics.}
