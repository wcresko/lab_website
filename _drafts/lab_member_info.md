Current Lab Members

1.)	Susan Bassham,  Senior Research Associate
a.	Email: sbassham@uoregon.edu
b.	Ph.D. Biology, University of Oregon
c.	Thesis title: “Molecular embryology of a larvacean urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, and the origin of chordate innovations”
d.	Research Interest: What are the developmental and genetic bases of evolution in natural populations? Using a variety of molecular genetic tools, I try to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and to direct this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.

2.)	Clay Small, Senior Research Associate
a.	Email: csmall@uoregon.edu
b.	Ph.D. Zoology, Texas A&M University
c.	Thesis title:
d.	Research Interest: The characterization of transcriptomic phenotypes using RNA-seq is a promising approach for understanding how genomes serve as conduits for the origin, maintenance and modification of ecologically relevant traits. To this end, I study the male pregnancy transcriptome in syngnathid fishes, and how genotype-by-environment interactions affect the microbe-associated gastrointestinal transcriptome of threespine stickleback.

3.)	Mark Currey, Senior Research Assistant
a.	Email: mcurrey@uoregon.edu
b.	M.S. Biology; University of Oregon
c.	Thesis title: “The phenotypic and genetic distribution of threespine stickleback that inhabit the Willamette Basin, Oregon USA”
d.	Research Interest: I'm interested in understanding the vast variety of life. How is morphological variation, seen in populations of the same species, partitioned among different environments and what are the genetic and genomic factors associated with this partitioning? To get at this I'm investigating the distribution of populations of threespine stickleback in Oregon, looking for patterns of association between phenotype and environment, and ultimately querying the genomes of these populations to associate patterns we see at the phenotypic level with patterns at the genetic and genomic level.

4.)	Emily Beck, Postdoctoral Research Fellow
a.	Email: ebeck8@uoregon.edu
b.	Ph.D. Genetics; University of Iowa
c.	Thesis title: “Impacts of Protein-protein interactions on speciation in Drosophila”
d.	Research Interest: I am a geneticist with a long-standing interest in how genetic interactions influence evolutionary dynamics and how those dynamics impact disease states. My doctoral thesis work primarily focused on mitochondrial and nuclear genome interactions as they relate to speciation in Drosophila. As a postdoctoral research fellow, I significantly extended my experiences to focus on host-microbe interactions and their broader influences on progression of disease states in outbred threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus).

5.)	Martin Stervander, Postdoctoral Research Fellow
a.	Email: mste@uoregon.edu
b.	Ph.D. Evolutionary Biology; Lund University
c.	Thesis title: “On Speciation in Birds – Genomic Signatures Across Space and Time”
d.	Research Interest: I am broadly interested in evolutionary biology and ecology, with a passion for birds. In my Ph.D. project, I used traditional and "next generation" DNA sequencing to study speciation processes in several groups of birds, and focused on natural selection on bill morphology. In my postdoc project I keep my eye on the feeding apparatus, but go below the surface to study the development and evolution of the highly derived craniofacial morphology of pipefishes and seahorses.

6.)	Hannah Tavalire, Postdoctoral Research Scholar
a.	Email: tavalire@uoregon.edu
b.	Ph.D. Biology; Oregon State University
c.	Thesis title: “Trade-offs in a pathogen-rich world: genetic and maternal drivers of variation in costly resistance and immunity in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer)”
d.	Research Interest: My broad research interests center around determining the genetic and environmental basis for phenotypic traits using genomic and classical quantitative genetics approaches. Specifically, I am interested in the intimate coevolutionary relationships between hosts and their symbionts, whether these relationships are categorized as parasitic, commensal, or mutualistic in nature. I am currently working on the Early Growth and Development Study (EGDS) with Leslie Leve, using a quantitative genetics approach to estimate the heritability of the microbiome and other related child health traits.

8.)	Emily Niebergall, Undergraduate Researcher; Clark Honors College
a.	Email: enieberg@uoregon.edu
b.	Major: Biology
c.	Research Interest: “I am interested in studying the onset of adaptive immunity in threespine stickleback fish. By pinpointing the onset of the adaptive immune system, threespine stickleback can be advanced as models for immunogenetics studies. I am also interested in studying the impact of microbial influence on the development of the adaptive immune system.”
