Recommended: At the start of each project, design your plan for authorship of the project so
everyone knows the expectations

Authorship criteria:
1) Makes a significant intellectual contribution to research ideas and experimental design
OR
2) Makes a significant contribution to data acquisition, data generation, data analysis, data
interpretation, research coordination, and/or financial support of research

AND

3) Contributes to writing part of the manuscript, in addition to editing revisions before
submission for publication

AND

4) Remains involved throughout the submission and revision process until final publication
*Research participants not meeting the criteria should be listed in the Acknowledgements
section of the final published manuscript

Authorship order:
Generally, the person who had the most significant contribution to the project and who does
most of the writing will be the first author. In ecology, the last author is generally the PI of the
lab (although not always). The remaining authors are usually listed in their order of
contribution. However, if contributions were equivalent, then co-authors can be alphabetized
or ordered according to their time since involvement in the project.
