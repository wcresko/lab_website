<section id="cresko-laboratory-expectations" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="cresko-laboratory-expectations">Cresko Laboratory Expectations</h2>
<p>We in the Cresko Laboratory are committed to maintaining an environment in which every one of us can learn, thrive, and build the skills we need to further our career paths in academia, industry, teaching, and beyond. We are proud to be a diverse group that strives to support a multitude of nationalities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, cultures, and intellectual backgrounds within the lab. As part of our mission to advance evolutionary genomics through rigorous science and inclusive collaboration, we have developed this set of expectations for our group, so that there is transparent documentation of what we should expect from one another.</p>
</section>
<section id="respect" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="respect">Respect</h2>
<p>We are here to learn and do science first and foremost. This can only happen effectively in an environment of mutual respect. Everyone comes with a different knowledge base and unique intellectual strengths. Our goal is to establish an environment where all of our contributions and abilities are celebrated, and where it is safe to be wrong, make mistakes, and learn from them. We require all members to treat others how they themselves would wish to be treated, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to the ideas of others</li>
<li>Making sure that everyone has a voice at the table</li>
<li>Making sure that the entire group feels supported</li>
<li>Using preferred pronouns</li>
<li>Pronouncing names correctly</li>
<li>Providing constructive feedback (rather than scathing criticism)</li>
<li>Actively listening to all perspectives</li>
</ul>
<p>Intellectual bullying and inappropriate comments will not be tolerated, including those about appearance, race, gender, religion, ability/disability, sexual orientation, or identity.</p>
</section>
<section id="work-expectations" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="work-expectations">Work Expectations</h2>
<section id="showing-up-hours" class="level3">
<h3 data-anchor-id="showing-up-hours">Showing Up / Hours</h3>
<p>Ultimately what we do here is a job. We expect that you will treat your position in the group as such. While many jobs require strict hours in the workplace, it is relatively easy for us, as computational and evolutionary biologists, to have a lot more freedom. While that is so, one of your responsibilities is to the group, and participation in the intellectual activities of the group is important. We find this works best if all members are physically present for a reasonable number of hours during the week, which will change depending on circumstances such as remote work arrangements or field work commitments. When physical presence is not possible during the work day, we expect members to be responsive to virtual communication.</p>
<p>We expect everyone to: - Attend lab meetings and journal clubs in-person or virtually - Be present for group seminars and presentations - Participate in collaborative discussions - Take vacations and time off to maintain work-life balance - Enjoy the incredible outdoor opportunities of the Pacific Northwest</p>
<p>We recognize that overworking has deleterious effects and we do not expect you to work outside your normal work hours. Burnout is common and we want to avoid it. We support members in prioritizing mental and physical health. We often organize inclusive group activities (with families, partners, etc.) such as field trips, mushroom hunting, or potluck dinners, however there is no obligation to join these events. We encourage members to share their own interests with the group.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-we-expect-from-one-another" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="what-we-expect-from-one-another">What We Expect from One Another</h2>
<p>With the recognition that there are a number of different roles in our laboratory, each with a different collection of responsibilities, it is useful to establish explicitly what we can expect from one another.</p>
<section id="principal-investigator-bill-cresko" class="level3">
<h3 data-anchor-id="principal-investigator-bill-cresko">Principal Investigator (Bill Cresko)</h3>
<p>As PI, Bill is expected to maintain grant support for the group at a level that allows for all our research, publications, salary support, travel, etc. to continue. He is firmly committed to the career development of group members. You can expect him to work with you on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining research questions</li>
<li>Writing and reviewing code</li>
<li>Discussing and interpreting analyses</li>
<li>Writing and editing manuscripts</li>
<li>Seeking your own external funding</li>
<li>Weekly one-on-one meetings if desired</li>

<li>Reading relevant literature in evolutionary genomics and related fields</li>
<li>Writing and reviewing code for analyses</li>
<li>Sharing code openly with the group at all stages of completion</li>

<p>The Cresko Laboratory is housed within the greater community of scholars that is the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (IE2). We expect members of our group to interact with and contribute to the IE2 community as well. This helps to situate our research in the broader context and to introduce new ideas and collaborations into our work. Some ways to participate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attending weekly IE2 seminars</li>
<li>Being part of IE2 journal clubs (e.g., EvoGen journal club, Microbiome journal club)</li>
<li>Participating in regular social engagements such as Tea Time</li>

</section>
<section id="open-science" class="level2">
<h2 data-anchor-id="open-science">Open Science</h2>
<p>We are working to make knowledge available to everyone, and so are deeply committed to sharing our code and publications freely and transparently with the world. Our open science practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All code written is open source, generally using MIT, GPL, or CC-BY licensing</li>
