As Susan Bassham, co-author and senior research associate notes, stickleback have evolved as a species with regions of their genomes alternatively honed for either freshwater or marine life, allowing rapid adaptation when environments change."

This research addresses:\n\nHow host genetics shapes microbiome composition\nThe role of the microbiome in host adaptation\nCoevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their microbiota\nEnvironmental influences on host-microbiome interactions\n\n\n\nPopulation Genomics Methods Development\nOur laboratory has been at the forefront of developing genomic tools and computational methods for evolutionary biology:\n\nRAD-seq Technology\nWe developed Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), a method that has revolutionized population genomics by enabling cost-effective genome-wide SNP discovery and genotyping in non-model organisms.\n\n\nStacks Software Pipeline\nWe created Stacks, a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences. Stacks is now used by thousands of researchers worldwide for: - De novo and reference-based assembly of RAD-seq data - SNP discovery and genotyping - Population genomics analyses - Phylogenomics applications\nVisit the Stacks website →\n\n\n\nSyngnathid Fish Evolution\nIn collaboration with international partners, we study the unique evolutionary innovations of syngnathid fishes (seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons):\n\nMale pregnancy and its genomic basis\nEvolution of morphological novelties\nComparative genomics across the syngnathid phylogeny\nConservation genomics of threatened species\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Evolutionary Responses\nWe investigate how organisms respond to rapid environmental change, including:\n\nThermal adaptation in natural populations\nOcean acidification effects on marine organisms\nEvolutionary rescue and adaptive potential\nPredicting evolutionary responses to climate change"

By capitalizing on the invasive water flea, Daphnia lumholtzi’s, dramatic morphological response to predation, I am working to disentangle the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this plastic response and its persistence over generational time."
