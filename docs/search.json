Some of the most striking morphological differences can be observed when comparing freshwater and marine fish, whose skeletons may differ in:\n\nSize and scaling: Overall body size and proportions\nShape variations: Cranial bone morphology and body streamlining\nElement number: Lateral plate counts and gill raker numbers\nRobustness: Bone thickness and mineralization patterns\n\nRich phenotypic variation is seen in populations where these ecotypes have interbred, providing natural experiments in the genetics of complex traits."

While that is so, one of your responsibilities is to the group, and participation in the intellectual activities of the group is important. We find this works best if all members are physically present for a reasonable number of hours during the week, which will change depending on circumstances such as remote work arrangements or field work commitments. When physical presence is not possible during the work day, we expect members to be responsive to virtual communication.\nWe expect everyone to: - Attend lab meetings and journal clubs in-person or virtually - Be present for group seminars and presentations - Participate in collaborative discussions - Take vacations and time off to maintain work-life balance - Enjoy the incredible outdoor opportunities of the Pacific Northwest\nWe recognize that overworking has deleterious effects and we do not expect you to work outside your normal work hours. Burnout is common and we want to avoid it. We support members in prioritizing mental and physical health. We often organize inclusive group activities (with families, partners, etc.) such as field trips, mushroom hunting, or potluck dinners, however there is no obligation to join these events.

He is firmly committed to the career development of group members. You can expect him to work with you on:\n\nDefining research questions\nWriting and reviewing code\nDiscussing and interpreting analyses\nWriting and editing manuscripts\nSeeking your own external funding\nWeekly one-on-one meetings if desired\nMitigating conflicts (interpersonal or scientific) that arise in the lab\nConnecting you with additional mentorship and resources as needed\nSupporting your professional development and career goals\n\n\n\nStaff Scientists (Research Associates and Research Scientists)\nStaff Scientists in the group play a special role in supporting research at all levels, from maintaining computational resources, to managing genomic datasets, to providing analysis support on individual projects. Responsibilities of staff include:\n\nWriting and reviewing code\nAnalyzing and interpreting genomic data and/or simulations\nProviding help to postdocs and graduate students with their research\nMaintaining laboratory resources and infrastructure\nSharing code openly with the group at all stages of completion\nDisseminating production code openly via GitHub or similar platforms\nReading and discussing papers in journal club\nContributing to method development and protocol optimization\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researchers and Graduate Students\nPostdocs and graduate students in the group are expected to actively develop and pursue their own research in consultation with Bill and in collaboration with others. Recognizing that more junior lab members need more support initially than do more senior members, our expectations for trainees include:\n\nReading relevant literature in evolutionary genomics and related fields\nWriting and reviewing code for analyses\nSharing code openly with the group at all stages of completion\nDisseminating production code openly via GitHub or similar platforms\nAnalyzing and interpreting genomic data and/or simulations\nReading and discussing papers in journal club\nLeading lab meeting to discuss your work in progress approximately quarterly\nDrafting, editing, and eventually submitting manuscripts\nPresenting results at annual (inter)national meetings\nSeeking your own external funding and/or other future career opportunities\nProviding constructive feedback to other lab members on papers, presentations, proposals, etc.\nContributing to the mentorship of junior lab members\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Researchers\nUndergraduate researchers in the group generally are paired with a particular postdoc or graduate student, advancing projects under a mentorship umbrella. Their responsibilities include:\n\nReading relevant literature\nWriting and reviewing code\nSharing code openly with the group at all stages of completion\nDisseminating production code openly via GitHub or similar platforms\nAnalyzing and interpreting data and/or simulations\nParticipating in journal club when schedule permits\nPresenting research progress in lab meetings\nContributing to manuscript preparation when appropriate"

Using a variety of molecular genetic tools, I work to uncover genome-scale patterns that underlie phenotypic variation in wild populations of fish, and direct this knowledge to the study of developmental pathways that contribute to novel or modified morphologies.\n\nCurrent Research Areas\n\nEvolutionary Developmental Biology: Understanding how developmental mechanisms evolve to produce morphological diversity\nPopulation Genomics: Applying genomic approaches to study adaptation in natural populations\nStickleback Evolution: Using threespine stickleback as a model for rapid evolutionary change\nMolecular Genetics: Developing and applying molecular tools for evolutionary studies"
