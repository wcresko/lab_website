Using the threespine stickleback fish as our primary model system, we study:\n\nParallel evolution: How do independent populations evolve similar solutions to environmental challenges?\nGenomic architecture: What is the genetic basis of complex adaptive traits?\nEvolutionary constraints: What factors limit or facilitate evolutionary change?\n\nOur work has revealed fundamental principles about how natural selection shapes genomic variation and produces evolutionary change.\n\n\nHost-Microbiome Coevolution\nRecently, our lab has developed stickleback as a model for studies of how host genetic variation influences associated microbial communities. This research addresses:\n\nHow host genetics shapes microbiome composition\nThe role of the microbiome in host adaptation\nCoevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their microbiota\nEnvironmental influences on host-microbiome interactions\n\n\n\nPopulation Genomics Methods Development\nOur laboratory has been at the forefront of developing genomic tools and computational methods for evolutionary biology:\n\nRAD-seq Technology\nWe developed Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), a method that has revolutionized population genomics by enabling cost-effective genome-wide SNP discovery and genotyping in non-model organisms.\n\n\nStacks Software Pipeline\nWe created Stacks, a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences. Stacks is now used by thousands of researchers worldwide for: - De novo and reference-based assembly of RAD-seq data - SNP discovery and genotyping - Population genomics analyses - Phylogenomics applications\nVisit the Stacks website →\n\n\n\nSyngnathid Fish Evolution\nIn collaboration with international partners, we study the unique evolutionary innovations of syngnathid fishes (seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons):\n\nMale pregnancy and its genomic basis\nEvolution of morphological novelties\nComparative genomics across the syngnathid phylogeny\nConservation genomics of threatened species\n\n\n\nClimate Change and Evolutionary Responses\nWe investigate how organisms respond to rapid environmental change, including:\n\nThermal adaptation in natural populations\nOcean acidification effects on marine organisms\nEvolutionary rescue and adaptive potential\nPredicting evolutionary responses to climate change"
