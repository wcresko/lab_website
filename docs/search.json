As Susan Bassham, co-author and senior research associate notes, stickleback have evolved as a species with regions of their genomes alternatively honed for either freshwater or marine life, allowing rapid adaptation when environments change."

The goal of our lab is to understand how it arises - what genes and developmental processes are involved, how changes in these systems are integrated into genomes, and how these proximate mechanisms affect ultimate evolutionary processes. Our lab uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to address these and other evolutionary genetic questions.\nBill is a Professor of Biology and member of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon, with leadership roles as associate vice president of research and leader of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science.

Beck\nPh.D. Candidate\nEmily is interested in the genetics of adaptation and how complex traits evolve quickly in response to new or changing environments. Her work focuses on mitochondrial-nuclear interactions and their role in evolutionary adaptation.\n\n\nMark C. Currey\nPh.D. Candidate\nMark characterizes transcriptomic phenotypes using RNA-seq to understand how genomes serve as conduits for the origin, maintenance and modification of ecological variation. His work on Oregon stickleback populations has revealed patterns of genetic divergence across different timescales.\n\n\nHannah M. Healey\nPh.D. Student\nHannah applies single-cell sequencing technologies to understand developmental processes and gene expression variation in stickleback.
