## Biography

Bill Cresko is a Professor of Biology, the Lorry Lokey Chair in Bioengineering, and Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Oregon. He serves as Director of the Center for Biomedical Data Science in the Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. With career funding exceeding \$60 million, Bill has established himself as a leader in evolutionary genomics, developing tools and approaches that are used by thousands of scientists worldwide.

Bill studies the genomic basis of evolutionary change using comparative studies of natural populations in the wild and experimental approaches in the laboratory. He uses the threespine stickleback fish as his primary model to understand how molecular genetic variation can modify networks of genes and proteins to produce variation in evolutionarily important traits. His lab is also well known for developing genomic tools (e.g. RAD-seq) and super-computing software (e.g. Stacks), both of which are now used by thousands of scientists around the world.
