## Biography

Martin Stervander is a postdoctoral research fellow on a three-year grant from the Swedish Research Council. In the Cresko Lab at the Institute of Ecology and Evolution (IE2), University of Oregon, he conducts research in comparative genomics of syngnathid fishes. With a background in phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses of birds, his overall research interests span microevolutionary dynamics to large-scale macroevolution. Martin has published over 20 papers that have been cited over a thousand times.
