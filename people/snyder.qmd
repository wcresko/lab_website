## Biography

Shannon Snyder is a graduate student in the Cresko Laboratory focusing on the evolution of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. Using the invasive water flea *Daphnia lumholtzi* as a model system, Shannon investigates how organisms respond to environmental threats across multiple generations and the molecular mechanisms underlying these remarkable adaptations.

## Education

-   **Ph.D. Candidate, Biology**, University of Oregon (in progress)
-   **M.S.**, Arizona State University
-   **B.S.**, Arizona State University

## Research Interests

My dissertation work focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms governing within and between generational phenotypic plasticity. By capitalizing on the invasive water flea, *Daphnia lumholtzi*'s, dramatic morphological response to predation, I am working to disentangle the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying this plastic response and its persistence over generational time.

## Current Research

### Transgenerational Plasticity in *Daphnia*

-   Investigating predator-induced morphological defenses
-   Tracking phenotypic changes across generations

-   Costs and benefits of phenotypic flexibility
-   Invasion biology and plasticity
-   Climate change and adaptive responses

## Research Approach

### Experimental Methods

-   Multi-generational exposure experiments
-   Predator cue manipulations
-   Morphological measurements
