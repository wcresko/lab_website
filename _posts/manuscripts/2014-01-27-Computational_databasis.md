The ability to efficiently obtain, manipulate, and interrogate this data is a valuable and empowering skill. In this chapter, we introduce several primary data repositories and describe the most commonly encountered file formats. In order to highlight some of the key concepts, operations, and utilities that are involved in working with annotation data we provide a fully worked example of using annotations to answer some basic questions about a particular CHIP-seq data set.
