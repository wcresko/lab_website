Genome‐wide analysis of genetic diversity (π) and correlations of alleles within individuals in subpopulations (FIS) supported a role for introgressive hybridization in coastal populations and a recent expansion in central Oregon. Our results exhibit the power of next‐generation sequencing genomic approaches such as RAD‐seq to identify both historical population structure and recent colonization history.
