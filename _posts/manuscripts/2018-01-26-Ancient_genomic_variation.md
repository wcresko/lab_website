The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has therefore been evolving throughout the 15‐million‐year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation.
