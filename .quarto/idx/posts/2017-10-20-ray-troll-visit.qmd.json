Ray, famous for his scientifically accurate and whimsical fish art, spent two days learning about stickleback evolution and our genomics research.\n\n\nRay Troll has spent decades creating art that celebrates fish evolution and paleontology. His visit to our lab was part of his ongoing project documenting the diversity of Pacific Northwest fishes. He was particularly fascinated by:\n\n- The dramatic differences between marine and freshwater stickleback forms\n- Our collection of preserved specimens from across Oregon and Alaska\n- The rapid evolution we've documented in post-earthquake populations\n- How genomic data reveals evolutionary relationships\n\n## Hands-On Experience\n\nDuring his visit, Ray:\n- Examined stickleback under the microscope, sketching their defensive spines and armor plates\n- Learned about RAD-seq and how we visualize genomic data\n- Discussed the intersection of art and science in communicating evolution\n- Created several preliminary sketches for future artwork featuring stickleback\n\n## Science Communication Through Art\n\n\"Ray's art makes evolution accessible and engaging for everyone,\" says Bill Cresko. \"His ability to combine scientific accuracy with humor and beauty helps people connect with these important concepts.\"\n\nRay's visit reinforces the importance of diverse approaches to science communication. His artwork has introduced thousands to evolutionary biology in ways that complement traditional scientific publications.\n\n## Future Collaboration\n\nRay is developing a new series on rapid evolution, potentially featuring our stickleback research. We're excited about this opportunity to share our science through his unique artistic lens.\n\n[Visit Ray Troll's website](https://www.trollart.com/) | [Follow Ray on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ratfishray/)","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWe were thrilled to host renowned artist Ray Troll at the Cresko Laboratory this week!
