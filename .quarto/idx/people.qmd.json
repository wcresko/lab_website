Our lab uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to address these and other evolutionary genetic questions.\n\nBill is a Professor of Biology and member of the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon, with leadership roles as associate vice president of research and leader of the Presidential Initiative in Data Science.
