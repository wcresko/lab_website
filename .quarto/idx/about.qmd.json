Since then, we have:\n\n-   Published nearly 150 peer-reviewed papers\n-   Developed RAD-seq technology, revolutionizing population genomics\n-   Created Stacks, now used by over 5,000 researchers worldwide\n-   Trained dozens of graduate students and postdocs\n-   Secured continuous funding from NSF, NIH, and private foundations such as Keck and Moore\n\n## Our Values\n\n### Excellence in Science\n\nWe strive for rigorous, reproducible research that advances fundamental knowledge while addressing real-world challenges.\n\n### Inclusive Community\n\nWe foster a diverse, supportive environment where all members can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives.\n\n### Collaborative Spirit\n\nWe actively collaborate with researchers worldwide, believing that the best science emerges from diverse partnerships.\n\n### Mentorship & Training\n\nWe are committed to training the next generation of scientists through hands-on research experience and professional development.\n\nRead\n\n## Our Impact\n\n### Scientific Contributions\n\n-   **RAD-seq Technology**: Enabled genome-wide studies in thousands of non-model organisms\n-   **Stacks Software**: Democratized population genomics analyses for the global research community\n-   **Evolutionary Insights**: Advanced understanding of parallel evolution and adaptation\n\n### Education & Outreach\n\n-   Trained over 50 undergraduate researchers\n-   Mentored 25+ graduate students and 15+ postdocs\n-   Engaged with K-12 students through outreach programs\n-   Contributed to science communication and public understanding\n\n## Our Location\n\nWe are located in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon.
