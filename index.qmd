We study the genomic basis of evolutionary change using the threespine stickleback fish as our primary model system. Our research combines field studies, laboratory experiments, and computational approaches to understand how organisms adapt to changing environments.

## Research Areas

**Parallel Evolution & Adaptation** — We study how independent populations evolve similar solutions to environmental challenges, revealing the predictability of evolution and the genetic architecture of adaptive traits.

**Host-Microbiome Dynamics** — Using stickleback as a model, we explore how host genetic variation shapes microbial communities and how these interactions influence adaptation.

**Genomic Tool Development** — We developed RAD-seq technology and the Stacks software pipeline, now used by thousands of researchers worldwide for population genomics analyses.
