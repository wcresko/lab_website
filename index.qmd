### We study the genomic basis of evolutionary change. Our research combines field studies, laboratory experiments, and computational approaches to understand how organisms adapt to changing environments.

## Research Areas

**Parallel Evolution & Adaptation** — We study how independent populations evolve similar solutions to environmental challenges to understand the genetic architecture of adaptive traits.

**Functional Evolutionary Genetics** - We study how gene regulatory networks function in variable environments, and evolve in diverse lineages using approaches such as single cell sequencing and CRISPR

**Host-Microbiome Dynamics** — We explore how host genetic variation shapes microbial communities and how these interactions influence adaptation.

**Genomic Tool Development** — We developed RAD-seq technology and the Stacks software pipeline, now used by thousands of researchers worldwide for population genomics analyses.
